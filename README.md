This is my first react project after a long time, I felt that I was moving to fast and I needed to stop my Reactjs learning and come back into VanillaJS once again!

This was a particularly desired project that I was looking for since a long time ago and I had some issues/ dificults during it's building.

1 - I didn't care much about CSS before and I just forgot how to add a simple font from a different source than Google fonts! Thank God we have Mr. Google and Dev.to (https://dev.to/ziqinyeow/how-to-add-custom-font-file-to-your-react-app-31kb) @ziqinyeow - Thank you for the tutorial!
